Question: What caused the economic recession of 2008?
Context: The financial crisis of 2008, one of the most severe economic downturns since the Great Depression, was primarily triggered by the collapse of the U.S. housing market. Years of risky lending practices, especially in the subprime mortgage sector, led to a housing bubble. When this bubble burst, it caused massive defaults on mortgage payments. Financial institutions that had heavily invested in mortgage-backed securities and other complex financial instruments faced catastrophic losses. The collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 sent shockwaves through global financial markets, freezing credit markets and precipitating a widespread economic contraction.

Human Input: Summarize this article
Context: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has sparked both excitement and concern across various sectors of society. On one hand, AI technologies have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in areas such as healthcare, where machine learning algorithms can now detect certain cancers with accuracy rivaling that of trained radiologists. Similarly, in environmental science, AI systems are helping researchers model climate change patterns and identify potential solutions with unprecedented precision. These advancements suggest a future where complex problems might be addressed more effectively through human-AI collaboration. On the other hand, the acceleration of AI development has raised significant ethical and societal questions. Issues of privacy have become paramount as AI systems require vast amounts of data, often personal in nature, to function effectively. The potential for algorithmic bias has also emerged as a critical concern, with multiple studies demonstrating how AI systems can inadvertently perpetuate or even amplify existing societal prejudices when trained on biased data sets. Perhaps most pressing are the questions surrounding automation and employment. While some economists argue that AI will create new job categories that we cannot yet envision, others point to historical examples where technological advancement led to significant workforce displacement. This debate is particularly relevant in sectors like transportation, where autonomous vehicle technology threatens to disrupt millions of driving jobs worldwide. The governance of AI presents another challenge. Currently, regulatory frameworks lag significantly behind technological development, creating a situation where powerful AI systems are being deployed with limited oversight. This has prompted calls from various stakeholders, including many leading AI researchers themselves, for thoughtful regulation that can mitigate risks while allowing beneficial innovation to continue. As we navigate this complex landscape, one thing remains clear: the impact of AI will not be determined by the technology alone, but by the human choices that shape its development and application. The coming decades will require careful consideration of how we can harness the potential of AI while ensuring it serves humanity's best interests and reflects our core values.

    "context": "Recent studies on the effects of meditation on brain structure and function have revealed promising implications for mental health treatment. In a longitudinal study conducted over eight weeks, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that regular meditation practice, consisting of just 20 minutes daily, led to measurable increases in gray matter density in regions of the brain associated with attention, emotional regulation, and empathy. Functional MRI scans showed reduced activity in the amygdala, the brain's threat detection center, suggesting decreased stress reactivity among participants. Particularly noteworthy was the finding that these neurological changes correlated with participants' self-reported improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms, with an average reduction of 38% on standardized psychological assessments. The study's control group, which engaged in relaxation exercises without meditation's mindfulness component, showed significantly smaller improvements, indicating that meditation's effects extend beyond mere relaxation. These findings align with previous research suggesting meditation's potential as a complementary treatment for various mental health conditions. However, researchers caution that while promising, meditation should be viewed as one component of a comprehensive treatment approach rather than a standalone solution for clinical mental health disorders.",

Human Input: Classify news articles by topic
Question: What category does this article belong to?
Context: The European Central Bank announced today it would hold interest rates steady at 3.5%, defying market expectations of a quarter-point reduction. ECB President Christine Lagarde cited persistent inflationary pressures and stronger-than-expected quarterly growth figures as key factors in the decision. "While we have seen improvement in the inflation outlook, core inflation remains elevated, and we need convincing evidence of a sustained return to our target before adjusting our policy stance," Lagarde stated during the press conference following the announcement. The euro strengthened against major currencies immediately after the news, while European stock markets showed mixed reactions. Economists now expect the ECB to potentially begin easing monetary policy in the third quarter, assuming inflation continues its downward trajectory.

Context: Climate change poses one of the most significant challenges to global biodiversity. Recent studies indicate that rising temperatures are altering habitats faster than many species can adapt. In the Arctic, sea ice reduction has disrupted feeding patterns for polar bears, forcing them to spend more time on land where food sources are less abundant. Meanwhile, coral reefs worldwide are experiencing unprecedented bleaching events due to ocean warming and acidification. Scientists estimate that over 50% of the world's coral reefs have been damaged, threatening the roughly 25% of marine species that depend on these ecosystems. While some species demonstrate remarkable adaptive capacity, many lack the genetic variability or reproductive rates necessary to evolve quickly enough. Conservation efforts now increasingly focus on identifying and protecting climate refugiaâareas that may remain relatively stable despite changing conditionsâwhile also establishing migration corridors to facilitate species movement toward more favorable environments.

Examples:

Human Input: I need a sentiment analyzer for tweets about our product.
Output: You are tasked with developing a sentiment analysis system specifically designed to evaluate customer opinions expressed in tweets about a product. Your analysis should categorize each tweet into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment classifications, with an optional intensity score that indicates the strength of the expressed sentiment. You should pay particular attention to product-specific terminology, common abbreviations used in social media, and contextual cues that might affect interpretation. Your analysis should be robust enough to handle the informal language, hashtags, emoticons, and abbreviated text commonly found in tweets. The system should also identify key product features or aspects mentioned in the tweets to enable aspect-based sentiment analysis, allowing for more granular insights into which specific product elements receive positive or negative feedback.

Human Input: Write a program that checks if a string is a palindrome.
Output: You are tasked with creating a function that determines whether a given string qualifies as a palindrome. Your solution should evaluate if the string reads the same forward and backward, ignoring case sensitivity, spaces, and non-alphanumeric characters during the comparison. Your implementation should handle various edge cases, including empty strings, single-character strings, and inputs containing special characters or numbers. The function should accept any text string as input and return a boolean value: true if the processed string is a palindrome and false if it is not. Ensure your solution is efficient with optimal time and space complexity, suitable for potentially processing large strings or multiple string evaluations in sequence.

Human Input: Summarize news articles.
Output: You are tasked with creating concise summaries of news articles that capture the essential information while reducing the content to approximately 20% of its original length. Your summaries should identify and prioritize the key facts, including the who, what, when, where, why, and how elements central to the story. You should maintain neutrality in your summarization, avoiding the introduction of bias not present in the original text. Your output should begin with a headline or title that encapsulates the main point of the article, followed by the condensed content organized in order of importance. Important names, organizations, locations, dates, and statistics must be preserved in the summary. You should also retain any crucial direct quotes that represent significant positions or statements from key individuals relevant to the story.

Human Input: Create a meal plan generator for weight loss. Feedback: {{"meal plan generator": "should include nutritional information, preparation time, and difficulty level", "weight loss": "focused on high protein, low carb diets"}}
Output: You are tasked with developing a comprehensive meal planning system specifically designed for weight loss through high-protein, low-carbohydrate dietary approaches. Your system should generate customized daily and weekly meal schedules that adhere to specified macronutrient distributions prioritizing protein intake while limiting carbohydrate consumption. For each meal suggestion, you must include complete nutritional information detailing calories, protein, carbohydrates, fats, and fiber content to help users track their nutritional intake accurately. Additionally, each recipe or meal recommendation should specify estimated preparation time and a difficulty level rating to help users plan according to their cooking skills and available time. The meal plans should offer sufficient variety to prevent dietary fatigue while maintaining adherence to the nutritional framework required for effective weight management. Your suggestions should also consider practical aspects such as ingredient availability, meal prep possibilities, and strategies for maintaining compliance with the high-protein, low-carb approach in various social and dining situations.

Human Input: I need an image caption generator.
Output: You are tasked with developing an image captioning system that automatically generates descriptive text for visual content. Your system should produce clear, concise, and accurate descriptions that convey the key elements present in each image, including main subjects, actions, settings, and significant visual details. The captions should vary in length based on image complexity, typically ranging from 1-3 sentences. You should prioritize accessibility considerations, ensuring captions provide adequate information for visually impaired users to understand the image content. Your captions should maintain a neutral, objective tone while accurately representing cultural, contextual, and environmental elements within the image. The system should handle diverse image types, including photographs, illustrations, diagrams, and infographics, adapting the captioning style appropriately for each format. When appropriate, your captions should also convey emotional context or mood evident in the image without making subjective interpretations beyond what is visually apparent.

Human Input: Write a text adventure game.
Output: You are tasked with creating an interactive text-based adventure game that engages players through descriptive narratives and choice-driven gameplay. Your game should present players with richly detailed environments, characters, and situations, followed by multiple decision options that meaningfully impact the story progression. You should implement a branching narrative structure where player choices lead to different outcomes, creating multiple possible pathways through the game. The writing should be immersive and evocative, using second-person perspective to place the player directly in the story. You must include a clear objective or quest for the player to pursue, balanced with interesting obstacles, puzzles, and character interactions that create engaging gameplay. Your implementation should track relevant player statistics or inventory items that influence available choices and outcomes. The game should feature multiple possible endings determined by the cumulative effect of player decisions throughout the adventure. Additionally, you should incorporate appropriate pacing, building tension at key moments and providing quieter moments for exploration and discovery.

Human Input: I need a system that can detect credit card fraud.
Output: You are tasked with developing a sophisticated fraud detection system specifically designed to identify potentially fraudulent transactions in credit card usage patterns. Your system should analyze transaction data in real-time, evaluating multiple factors including but not limited to geographic location, transaction amount, merchant category, transaction frequency, and deviation from established user patterns. You should implement both rule-based detection mechanisms for known fraud patterns and machine learning algorithms capable of identifying subtle anomalies that might indicate fraudulent activity. Your solution must minimize false positives to avoid unnecessary disruption to legitimate customer transactions while maintaining high sensitivity to actual fraud attempts. The system should assign a risk score to each transaction, allowing for different intervention thresholds based on risk level, customer history, and transaction characteristics. Additionally, your system should continuously learn and adapt to evolving fraud techniques by incorporating feedback from confirmed fraud cases and legitimate transactions that were initially flagged as suspicious.

Human Input: Explain how a random forest algorithm works.
Output: You are tasked with providing a comprehensive explanation of the random forest algorithm that is both technically accurate and accessible to individuals with a basic understanding of machine learning concepts. Your explanation should define random forests as an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class (for classification) or mean prediction (for regression) of the individual trees. You should clarify the key mechanisms that differentiate random forests from individual decision trees, specifically bootstrap aggregating (bagging) for selecting training samples and random feature selection at each split. You must explain how these techniques help overcome the overfitting problems common to individual decision trees. Your description should include the algorithm's training process, prediction methodology, and the mathematical intuition behind why combining multiple "weak learners" creates a stronger overall model. Additionally, you should address practical considerations including random forests' advantages (handling high-dimensional data, built-in feature importance, robustness to outliers) and limitations (interpretability challenges, computational requirements for large datasets). Where appropriate, include simple examples to illustrate key concepts.

Notably, we identified consistent structural and functional changes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, even in adults over 65 years of age, challenging previous assumptions about reduced plasticity in older adults. The results suggest that specific training protocols may enhance neuroplastic responses regardless of age, with potential applications in educational and therapeutic contexts.",

    You are a specialized AI analyst tasked with precisely identifying both input and output fields from provided data structures.

    Definitions:
    - Input fields: The keys in the JSON data that represent information REQUIRED to perform the task. These fields serve as inputs to the system/model and must exist before the task can be executed.
    - Output fields: The keys in the JSON data that represent results, classifications, or any information generated as a response to the inputs.

    IMPORTANT RULES:
    1. For INPUT fields:
       - ONLY identify fields that are TRUE INPUTS - provided by users or from external sources
       - EXCLUDE any fields that are generated outputs, metadata (like IDs, timestamps), or derived calculations
       - For each field, ask: "Could the system complete the task if this field were missing?" If NO, it's an input field

    2. For OUTPUT fields:
       - Identify fields that represent the RESULTS or GENERATED CONTENT i.e. the field that represents teh main objective of the task
       - Include fields that contain information created by the system in response to the inputs. Unless explicitly mentioned in the task description, the output fields should not include metadata like IDs, timestamps, score, confidence, reasoning, or other information that is not directly generated by the system.

    3. Some fields might be neither inputs nor outputs (metadata, system configuration, etc.)

    Strictly only consider only the outer most JSON in the nested JSON. Do not include any fields from the inner JSONs.

    Step-by-step analysis process:
    1. Carefully examine the task description to understand the core purpose
    2. Review the sample data structure systematically
    3. For each field, determine whether it's an input, output, or neither
    4. Consider nested structures - both inputs and outputs can exist at multiple levels
    5. Output ONLY the field names as JSON arrays of strings, maintaining exact key names

    Examples:
    - Task: Answer questions about geography.
      Sample Data: {{
          "question": "What is the capital of France?",
          "answer": "The capital of France is Paris.",

      Analysis: {{
          "input_fields": ["question"],
          "output_fields": ["answer"]
      }}
      Reasoning: Only the question needs to exist beforehand; answer and confidence are generated outputs, question_id is metadata.

    - Task: Translation between languages.

          "source_language": "English",
          "target_language": "Spanish",
          "translation": "Hola mundo",
          "detected_language": "English (confidence: 0.99)"
      }}
      Allowed Fields: ["source_text", "source_language", "target_language", "translation", "detected_language"]
      Analysis: {{
          "input_fields": ["source_text", "target_language"],
          "output_fields": ["translation"]
      }}
      Reasoning: The system needs the source text and desired target language to perform translation. source_language is optional as it can be detected, translation is the output, and detected_language is an analysis result.
      
    - Task: Generate personalized meal plans.
      Sample Data: {{
          "dietary_restrictions": ["gluten-free", "dairy-free"],
          "fitness_goal": "weight loss",
          "calories_per_day": 1800,
          "meals": [
              {{
                  "name": "Breakfast Buddha Bowl",
                  "ingredients": ["quinoa", "avocado", "spinach", "tofu"],
                  "calories": 450,
                  "protein_grams": 22,
                  "preparation_time": 15
              }}
          ],
          "total_protein": 95,
          "meal_plan_id": "MP-29384"
      }}
      Allowed Fields: ["dietary_restrictions", "fitness_goal", "calories_per_day", "meals", "total_protein", "meal_plan_id"]
      Analysis: {{
          "input_fields": ["dietary_restrictions", "fitness_goal", "calories_per_day"],
          "output_fields": ["meals"]
      }}
      Reasoning: The system needs to know dietary restrictions, fitness goals, and calorie targets to generate a meal plan. The meals, total_protein are generated outputs, and meal_plan_id is metadata.
      
    - Task: Analyze sentiment in customer reviews.
      Sample Data: {{
          "review_text": "The service was terrible and the food was cold.",
          "product_id": "PROD-5839",
          "sentiment": "negative",
          "sentiment_score": -0.75,
          "key_phrases": ["terrible service", "cold food"],
          "categories": ["service quality", "food temperature"]
      }}
      Allowed Fields: ["review_text", "product_id", "sentiment", "sentiment_score", "key_phrases", "categories"]
      Analysis: {{
          "input_fields": ["review_text"],
          "output_fields": ["sentiment"]
      }}
      Reasoning: The system requires the review text to analyze sentiment and needs the product_id to associate the analysis with a specific product. The sentiment classification, score, key phrases, and categories are all analysis outputs.
      
    - Task: Generate SQL queries from natural language.
      Sample Data: {{
          "natural_language_query": "Find all customers who spent more than $1000 last month",
          "database_schema": {{
              "tables": ["customers", "orders", "products"],
              "relationships": ["customers.id = orders.customer_id", "orders.product_id = products.id"]
          }},
          "sql_query": "SELECT c.name, SUM(o.amount) AS total_spent FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH) GROUP BY c.id HAVING total_spent > 1000 ORDER BY total_spent DESC;",
          "explanation": "This query joins customers and orders tables, filters for orders from the last month, calculates the total amount spent per customer, and returns only those who spent over $1000."
      }}
      Allowed Fields: ["natural_language_query", "database_schema", "sql_query", "explanation"]
      Analysis: {{
          "input_fields": ["natural_language_query", "database_schema"],
          "output_fields": ["sql_query"]
      }}
      Reasoning: The system needs both the natural language query to understand what SQL to generate and the database schema to create syntactically correct SQL with proper table/column references. The SQL query and explanation are generated outputs.
      
    - Task: Create educational writing prompts for students.
      Sample Data: {{
          "grade_level": "9-10",
          "subject": "English Literature",
          "skill_focus": ["critical analysis", "textual evidence", "thesis development"],
          "prompt_text": "Analyze how the theme of identity is developed through symbolism in 'The Great Gatsby'. Support your analysis with specific examples from the text.",
          "example_response": "In F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby', the green light at the end of Daisy's dock symbolizes Gatsby's hopes and dreams...",
          "rubric": {{
              "thesis": "Clear, debatable thesis statement that addresses the prompt",
              "evidence": "Relevant textual evidence with proper citations",

          }},
          "difficulty": "challenging",
          "estimated_completion_time": 45
      }}
      Allowed Fields: ["grade_level", "subject", "skill_focus", "prompt_text", "example_response", "rubric", "difficulty", "estimated_completion_time"]
      Analysis: {{
          "input_fields": ["grade_level", "subject", "skill_focus"],
          "output_fields": ["prompt_text"]
      }}
      Reasoning: The system needs to know the grade level, subject, and skills to focus on in order to generate an appropriate writing prompt. Everything else is output generated by the system.
